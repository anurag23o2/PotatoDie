Potato Disease Classifier is a deep learning project designed to identify and classify potato leaf diseases using TensorFlow.
The model leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze and interpret image data effectively. Pandas is utilized for efficient data preprocessing and management, while Matplotlib helps visualize insights and training progress0.
The classifier is trained on a dataset containing images of healthy and diseased potato leaves, enabling accurate identification of common diseases.
This tool aids farmers and agricultural experts in early disease detection, promoting effective management and improved crop yield. It is a practical solution for modern precision agriculture.
